# The-Smart-Home
In smart home, we facilitate two things to the user one is mirror, the mirror which we provide looks like normal mirror but, when someone stands in front of it the scene changes. The mirror provides a functional, user friendly and interactive UI to it's user to display messages. And the other facility is providing access to the home appliances, we can also access our daily home appliances like fans and lights usingAlexa. Here we use Raspberry pi and Alexa as back end which connects tofront end i.e, javascript and python. Thus, we can create a smart home for a human in their daily routine.
